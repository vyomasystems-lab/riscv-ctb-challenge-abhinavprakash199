# riscv_ctb_challenges
This repository contains the whole summary of hands on done by Abhinav Prakash (IS22MTECH14002) during the [RISC-V CTB 2023 Processor Design Verification Hackathon](https://community.riscv.org/events/details/risc-v-international-risc-v-academy-presents-risc-v-capture-the-bug-hackathon/) aims to introduce participants to the RISC-V ecosystem and familiarize them with the fundamentals of processor verification. Through this event, the RISC-V CTB imparts knowledge about the process of identifying bugs in RISC-V designs, emphasizing the importance of thorough processor verification.

# Level-1
## Challenge-1 logical
###  Identifying the Bug 
- To find the bug, we ran the `make` command and found the bug in 2 bugs.

### Correcting the Bug
- To correct the bug, we replaced z4 with any of the defined registers in RV32I, like t0. So final instruction of line no 15855 in `test.S` file in `and s7,ra,t0`.
- Whereas in the next bug, `addi` performs addition with immediate data and s0 is not immediate data, so we replace s0 with any immediate data like 2. So final instruction of line no 25584 in `test.S` file in `addi s5,t1,2`.
- Then we run the make command, which generates `test.disass`,`test.elf` and `test_spike.dump` files.

## Challenge-2 logical
###  Identifying the Bug
- To find the bug we ran `make` command, and found the loop is running infinite times, so we came out of the loop using `Ctrl+c` and `q` and tried to find the bug.

### Correcting the Bug
- We made the following changes in the code to run the loop properly.

- Finally, after running `make`, the required files were generated.

## Challenge-3 illegal
###  Identifying the Bug
- To find the bug we ran `make` command and found the loop was running infinite times, so we came out of the loop using `Ctrl+c` and `q` and tried to find the bug.

# Level-2
## Challenge-1 instructions
###  Identifying the Bug 
- To find the bug, we ran the `make` command and found some errors.
![Screenshot (2663)](https://github.com/vyomasystems-lab/riscv-ctb-challenge-abhinavprakash199/assets/120498080/3687b9d1-fd20-4797-a61c-c86bbe04555b)


### Correcting the Bug
- To find the bug, we went though the `rv32i.yaml` file and found an ISA-instruction-distribution of 64 bits which was initialized to 10 but was working in rv32i, so we changed it to 0.
  
![Screenshot (2665)](https://github.com/vyomasystems-lab/riscv-ctb-challenge-abhinavprakash199/assets/120498080/ad9a0ad9-c630-477c-9f5b-96b47b1a3aeb)
- We changed `rel_rv64m: 10` to `rel_rv64m: 0` to correct the bug.
- Finally, after running `make` the required files were generated.

## Challenge-2 exceptions
###  Identifying the Bug 
- To find the bug, we ran the `make` command and found it generated only one illegal exception.

### Correcting the Bug
- Here, we need to generate 10 illegal exceptions, so we made some changes in the `rv32i.yalm` file.
- Changed `total_instructions: 1000` to `total_instructions: 200`, `rel_rv32i.data: 10` to `rel_rv32i.data: 0` ,  `rel_rv32m: 0` to `rel_rv32m: 1` and `ecause00: 0` to `ecause00: 1`.


- Finally, after running the `make` command to generate all illegal exceptions, which are saved in generated `exception.log` file.
